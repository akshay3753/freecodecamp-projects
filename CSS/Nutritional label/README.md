# Nutrition Label Project

This project recreates a nutrition label using semantic HTML and structured CSS, following the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

It emphasizes visual alignment, semantic grouping, and modular styling through utility classes such as `.bold`, `.indent`, `.no-divider`, `.divider`, and `.note`.

Nutritional facts like **Total Fat 8g**, **Cholesterol 0mg**, and **Protein 3g** are built with nested `<span>` elements inside `<p>` tags to ensure precise alignment with their corresponding daily values.

Key concepts reinforced:
- Class-based styling for layout and borders
- Proper element nesting to control alignment
- Indentation via margin utilities
- Removal or application of dividers for visual flow
- Custom typography and spacing using font size and padding
- Final polishing with `.note` for footer indentation and spacing

This project was completed using HTML5 and CSS3 and demonstrates an attention to detail necessary for replicating real-world web layouts.
