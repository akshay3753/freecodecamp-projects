# 🕵️ Confidential Email Page

This is a top-secret email layout created using **HTML** and **CSS**, inspired by the freeCodeCamp lab [“Build a Confidential Email Page”](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-confidential-email-page/). It simulates a spy-themed message with redacted text, blurred intelligence, and stamped warnings.

## 💼 Project Features

- Semantic HTML5 structure using `<main>`, `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<span>`
- Custom-styled labels: `#confidential` and `#top-secret`
- CSS filters (`blur(3px)`) for “classified” content
- Rotated stamps using `transform: rotate()`
- Styled like a physical document with borders, padding, and subtle coloring

## 📁 File Structure

📦 confidential-email-page/ ├── index.html └── styles.css


- **index.html** — Contains the email layout and message body
- **styles.css** — Handles layout, typography, blur effects, and styling of stamps

## 🖥️ How to View
