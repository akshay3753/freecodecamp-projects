    <p>Dear Agent,<span class="blurred"> Spunk</span></p>
    
    <p>We have an emergency. The secret formula for our Mega Marshmallow has been <span class="blurred">compromised.</span> This formula is what makes our marshmallows the fluffiest and most delicious.</p>
    
    <p>We suspect that Professor Puff is behind this. He has taken the <span class="blurred">formula</span> to his hidden laboratory. Your mission is to infiltrate the lab and secure the formula before it's too late.</p>
    <p>Be sure to keep the <span class="blurred">lab's</span> location confidential. Any leak of this information could jeopardize the entire operation.</p>
