🃏 Playing Cards Webpage
This project is part of the freeCodeCamp “Build a Page of Playing Cards” lab. It’s built using semantic HTML and CSS flexbox layout—no images, just Unicode characters for suits!

✅ Features
Displays at least three playing cards using divs and text characters (♠, ♣, ♥, ♦)

Uses semantic HTML with a main tag and unique id

Each card has three sections: .left, .middle, .right

Styled entirely with CSS Flexbox for layout and alignment

🧱 Tech Stack
HTML5

CSS3 with Flexbox

🗂️ Folder Structure

index.html      → main HTML structure with three cards  
styles.css      → styling for layout, spacing, and alignment
README.md       → you’re reading it!

🧰 How to Run
Open index.html in your browser. You’ll see three card-shaped blocks styled and spaced using CSS.

🔍 Highlights
#playing-cards centers the card deck and allows it to wrap

.card uses display: flex with space-between to lay out internal sections

.left, .middle, and .right align individually with align-self

.middle uses flex-direction: column to stack card values and suits
