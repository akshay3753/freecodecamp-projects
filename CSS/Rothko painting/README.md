# 🎨 Rothko-Inspired CSS Painting

This project is a tribute to the iconic visual style of Mark Rothko, created using only **HTML** and **CSS**. It was built as part of the [freeCodeCamp Full Stack Developer Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/workshop-rothko-painting/), specifically within the CSS workshop.

## 🌟 Features

- Pure semantic HTML and modern CSS
- CSS filters like `blur()` and `sepia()` to replicate painterly texture
- Rounded corners and rotation transforms for an organic, abstract feel
- Centered layout within a “frame” for visual depth

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` – Basic structure with nested elements: `.frame`, `.canvas`, and three color blocks
- `styles.css` – All styling including layout, color, and visual effects



## 💡 Getting Started

To see it in action:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rothko-painting.git

Open index.html in your browser.
