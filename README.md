# FreeCodeCamp Projects 🧠💻

This repository contains all the projects I built while completing the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. Each folder includes a specific project that helped me understand and apply core web development concepts.

## ✅ What I've Learned

By working on these projects, I’ve gained hands-on experience in:

- Writing semantic HTML
- Linking and embedding images
- Creating lists, sections, and navigation
- Structuring web pages with good HTML practices
- Preparing files for deployment using Git & GitHub

## 📁 Projects Inside

- `HTML/CatPhotoApp/` – A simple static web page using only HTML, built as part of the Responsive Web Design certification.

More projects will be added here as I continue learning through the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
