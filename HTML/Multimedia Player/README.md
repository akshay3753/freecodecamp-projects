- A `.vtt` subtitle file is linked with the `<track>` element.
- Ensures better understanding for hearing-impaired users or non-native speakers.

## Technologies

- HTML5 `<video>`, `<source>`, and `<track>` tags
- Subtitles provided via WebVTT file format

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the video with subtitles.
